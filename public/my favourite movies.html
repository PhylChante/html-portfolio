<h1>The Best Movies Ever</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Inception is such a brilliantly written amd excellently performed movie. This was peak Leonardo DeCaprio. He did an commendable job depicting thinking and dreaming in a never thought about before way. This movie will change your perception of dreams and thoughts and how ideas are formed and executed. It is not ranked one of the geatest movies ever made for no reason.</p>
<h3>Little Women</h3>
<p>I have loved Little Women since the first time I saw it. It is set in 19th Century America when the ideas of feminism as we know it today were beginning to take root. It follows the lives of four sisters and how they carve out a place for themselves in the world based on their talents. There is an intersting love triangle there as well that you wouldn't want to miss. </p>
<h3>Serendipty</h3>
<p>I just watched this about a week ago so its possible I still have newness bias, but I loved it. I love a good romcom and this one kept me at the edge of my seat wih the twists and the close calls. And dont you just love the word Serendipity? Its not just beautiful phonetically but in meaning as well.</p>
