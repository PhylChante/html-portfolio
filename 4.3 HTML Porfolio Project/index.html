    <h3>Hello World!</h3>
    <p>My name is Phyllis Chante and I am an up and coming Web Developer; if I do say so myself. I am very pleased to launch a platform on which all my fun and incredible projects will be uploaded and you can access everything I have had the pleasure to create.</p>
    <p>I am so excited about this and I can't wait to see how this website shapes up over the months! Let us take a quick look at what I have created so far in this first week of my course.</p>

    <a href="./public/My birthday invite.html">Birthday Invite Project</a>
    <p>This is a simple invite to my next birthday which will be in a few months from now. I am actually quite excited about this one because I have some big plans that I hope to unfold on the day. This is a little preview of what it looks like.</p>

    <a href="./public/my favourite movies.html">My Favourite Movies</a>
    <p>This shows my top three most favourite movies ever. These movies have a very special place in my heart and I suppose they give a little sneak peek into my soul because they hold a very special place in my life.</p>
